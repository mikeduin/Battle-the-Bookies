        HOW TO MAKE YOUR PICKS
      </p>
      <p class="col m10">
        - Queue up a pick by clicking its button, then click the green checkmark to confirm your pick. A pick is not submitted until it's confirmed.
      </p>
      <p class="col m10">
        - Submit one pick at a time. To change your pick before it's confirmed, just click a different pick button.
      </p>
      <p class="col m10">
        - A submitted pick locks in the odds and price of the pick at time of submission, even if the odds change prior to the game's start time.
      </p>
      <p class="col m10">
        - Once a pick is submitted, it will show up in the <b> YOUR PICK </b> column. From that point forward it cannot be changed.
      </p>
      <p class="col m10">
        - Make sure to get each pick in before each game begins! A game locks at its scheduled start time; per the game rules, a missed/unsubmitted pick is an automatic loss.
      </p>
      <p class="col m10 howToBott">
        - If you have queued up a pick but have not confirmed it, it may disappear from the 'confirm' area in the event that odds refresh. This is expected behavior and is in place to ensure that an entrant is not able to select a stale line.
